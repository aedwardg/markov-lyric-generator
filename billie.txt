Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours
Where did you go?
I should know
But it's cold and I don't
Wanna be lonely so show me the way home
I can't lose another life
Hurry, I'm worried
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake
So where did you go?
I should know
But it's cold and I don't
Wanna be lonely so tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to
Hurry, I'm worried
Where did you go? I should know
But it's cold and I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?
They're playing our sound
Laying us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife
Six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom
Again
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please, I do
What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along
With me but she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad
Bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad
That you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean
I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad guy
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul so cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy (Duh)
I'm the bad guy
Gold teeth, my neck, my wrist is froze
(So icy)
I got more ice than, than the snow
That guy don't act like you don't know
That guy, so critical
Tattoos on both my sleeves, yeah I
Don't sleep, please don't wake me
Loosen my tie up, so I can breathe
It ain't political, oh no
Yeah I'm a bad guy
Ain't no holdin' back guy
Come off like a mad guy
Always got your back guy
Yeah I'm the real type
Keep you full of thrills type
Show you what it feels like
Got an open invite
I'm the bad guy, whoa (Duh)
I'm the bad guy (Duh)
I'm only good at being bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
(So icy)
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
(Let's go)
(I'm a bad guy)
(Damn right)
(I'm-I'm a bad guy)
(Oh yeah)
(I'm a—)
My boy's being sus
He was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends
And by that I mean
He cuts em off
(What?!)
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy's being sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father (who are you?)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that I mean he said he'd "change"
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy... I love... my split ends
My boy... I love
(Alright dude, go trip over a knife)
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
You want me to be yours well then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours well then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
When I was older
I was a sailor
On an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler
Than it should ever be
I'm on my back again
Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
Can we pretend?
I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more
Like all we ever do is see
How far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again
Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
In the flood
When I was older
I was a sailor
On an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler
Than it should ever be
I'm watching movies back to back
In black and white, I never
Seen anybody do it like I do it any better
Been going over you, I'm overdue for new endeavors
Nobody lonely like I'm lonely and I don't know whether
You'd really like it in the limelight
You'd sympathize with all the bad guys
I'm still a victim in my own right
But I'm the villain in my own eyes
When I was older
I was a sailor
On an open sea
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
I'm home alone, you're God knows where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Another story
Of girl meets boy
And gets destroyed
Another promise
Broken in two
The lucky view
Of fiction
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story
Of girl meets boy
He's okay
She's broken
He's the ocean waves
She's choking
Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story
Of girl meets boy
So picture perfect
It can't be real
And all you feel is numb
You see them talking
But hear no sound
To hit the ground and
(Fade)...
He's okay
She's broken
He's the ocean waves
She's choking
(Don't need it, d-don't need it)...
Don't want it, don't need it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it, don't want it
I wanna be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you like a hostage
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you like a hostage
Like a hostage
Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing, turnin' blue
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do (Like you do)
If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon
Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down
Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year-long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, déjà vu (Hmm)
If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, I'm leavin' soon
Sorry can't save me now (Sorry)
Sorry I don't know how (Sorry)
Sorry there's no way out (Sorry)
But down
Hmm, down
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I don't like staying at home
When the moon is bleeding red
Woke up stoned in the backseat
From a dream where my teeth fell out of my head
Cut it up, cut it up, yeah
Everybody's on something here
My God send chemical best friend
Skeleton whispering in my ear
Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is
Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
Used to take one
Now it's takes four
You don't get me high anymore
Runnin' through emergency rooms
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans
My handshake, cellophane, landscape
Mannequin faking it the best I can
Cadillac, Cadillac red
No hands on the steering wheel
I'm crashing this save-a-ho puppet show
UFO obliterate the way I feel
Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is
Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
Used to take one
Now it's takes four
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore
You're saying that you miss me, oh well
Never even got a kiss without a countdown
It's time to face the facts
You treat me like a snack
Only text back when you're hungry
Your love's so insecure
You're never really sure
Boy, you never listen
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby
You're saying that you're sorry, so what?
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up
It's time to come to terms
Put myself first when your bubble bursts
Got soap in your eye
I'm telling you it's wrong
To break into my songs
Boy, you got to listen
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby
So take this as my last reply
And play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try
To reach your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line
Press record and hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you
Oh oh
To erase you
Oh oh
To erase you
Oh oh
Oh oh
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share
I'm in their second-hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny now or ever
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)
Waking up at sundown
They're late to every party
Nobody's ever sorry
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (learning)
Make the same mistakes
Blame circumstance
I'm in their second-hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny now or ever
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake
In Silver Lake
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Come down
Hurting
Learning
Billie
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
(Come here)
Say it, spit it out. What is it exactly?
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ah)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (ah-ah)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ah)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna... end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna...
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
(Listen)
Keep you in the dark. What had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star?
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs are frozen, my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
(Careful)
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ah)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ah)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ah)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna... end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna...
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Your butt is mine, I'm gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
I'm giving you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
'Cause I'm telling you just watch your mouth
I know your game what you're about
But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you've seen nothing
So just wait till I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad, c'mon
You know I'm big, I'm bad, you know
You know I'm big, I'm bad, I'm really really bad
And the whole world's got has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?
The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones to hide your hands
But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
So just wait till I get through
Because I'm big, I'm bad, c'mon
You know I'm big, I'm bad, you know
You know I'm big, I'm bad, I'm really really bad
And the whole world's got to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?
You can pretend you don't miss me
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
You can pretend you don't miss me
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine (are you?)
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind
You can pretend you don't miss me
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
Everybody knows
You and I are suicide and stolen art (art)
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches broken hearts
You can pretend you don't miss me
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
Somebody new
Is gonna comfort you like you want me to
Somebody new
Is gonna comfort me like you never do
Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "Stay"
Wait time is the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always late
I look for you
And you look for me
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is damning
There's something that you would not like me to tell you
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is damning
There's something that you would not like me to tell you
Wait time is to blame
Mat top frame's a trip
We all have the time
Someone's always fed
I look for you, and you look away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground
Waking up is so much fun to do
(Tell me, don't tell me, there's something that you would not like me to tell you)
'80 movie make out party, yeah
(Tell me, don't tell me, there's something that you would not like me to tell you)
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back
Let you back
Lights out
You're not here holding me
I count
Every tear down my cheek
Instead of sheep
Sleep walk
Find myself on your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then I leave
I tried a little black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true
Cold days
Frozen lake in the park
Old ways
Make mistakes when I'm lost
Now it goes
Bad dreams
Might not mean anything
But you seem
Not to need anything
I tried a little black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true
I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue, hey
True blue
I tried a little black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
I tried a little black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true
And I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue, hey
True blue
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad bunny? Can't have mine?
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad bunny? Can't have mine?
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry...
Psych!
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad bunny? Can't have mine?
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might have been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the golden
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
"They don't deserve you"
I tried to scream
But my head was under water
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
"They don't deserve you"
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
I'm not crying on the phone when you call
What's the use in begging you to stay?
I'm not trying to save us anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause you're too far away
To make me feel better
And make it alright
To give me your sweater
Hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo
Push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo
Seven days in limbo
Seven days
I'll give all my weapons to you
We've said it all. No more bones to break
I'm done thinking that we might just spark enough
We're broken glass waiting to be washed away
Can't make me feel better
Make it alright
Give me your sweater
Hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo
Push me out the window
Nothing in common
Nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo
Seven days in limbo
Seven days
If you love me
Let me go
If you love me
Leave limbo
Can't make me feel better
And make it alright
Can't give me your sweater
Hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo
Just push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo
Seven days in limbo
Seven days
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet, quiet
You see a piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
You don't have to keep it quiet
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
You don't have to keep it quiet
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play
My Lucifer is lonely
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
All the good girls go to hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearing fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool
Why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow!
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
All the good girls go to hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My God is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now
(I cannot do this snowflake)
